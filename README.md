The difference between version 6 and version 5 can be seen clearly in the code:

> v5 beta

Version name format
```
v = version, this is in every versions name
digit 1 = the major release
digit 2&3 = (intended to be combined) the sub-release of the major release
_(word):
intial = initial (first) release
pre(num) = pre release
rev(num) = revised release (minimal changes)
hotfix = hotfix release, intended to quickly fix a common problem
```

Some versions are built upon other versions and some are not, put simply:
```
2019=>2020 : v0 -> v1 -> v2
2020=>2021 : v3
2021=>now  : v4 -> v5 -> v6
```
v4, v5 and v6 are techncially backwards compatible however you may encounter many issuees. You can change the version in `Settings.lua`
