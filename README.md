# Sword-Admin
Sword Admin is a secure alternative for Roblox administrative commands.

Initially created in 2019, this uses old and frankly "alternative" coding techniques. This was recreated in 2021 as "v4" and that is what this current version (v6) is based on. However, this still contains legacy code and it is recommended you **do not use this**.

This open-source github release may or may not stay up to date with the latest confirmed release on Roblox: https://www.roblox.com/library/4615463718/Sword-Admin-v6.
